# Windows Explorer-like Application

This is a Windows Explorer-like application built with a monorepo architecture, leveraging **Typescript**, **ElysiaJS**, **Vue 3**, and **Bun**. The project is structured into two main packages: `backend` and `frontend`, each serving its respective purpose.

## Features

### Backend
- Built with **ElysiaJS**, a fast and expressive backend framework.
- Uses **Bun** as the runtime for its speed and modern tooling.
- Integrates with **PostgreSQL** via `pg` and **TypeORM** for database management.
- Defines entities (e.g., `Item.ts`) to model data structures.
- Serves as the API layer for the frontend.

### Frontend
- Built with **Vue 3** for a reactive and component-based UI.
- Uses **Vite** for fast development and bundling.
- Includes reusable components like `ItemTree.vue` (for displaying a tree structure) and `ItemContent.vue` (for displaying item details).
- Styled with **PrimeVue** and **PrimeIcons** for a polished and responsive design.
- Uses **Axios** for API communication with the backend.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (v1.0 or later)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18 or later)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) (for the backend database)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/windows-explorer-app.git
   cd windows-explorer-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the project:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in the backend configuration.

---

## Running the Application

The root `package.json` includes scripts to simplify development and building:

### Development
To start both the frontend and backend in development mode, run:
```bash
bun run dev
```
This uses `concurrently` to run the frontend and backend simultaneously.

- Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Backend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build
To build both the frontend and backend for production, run:
```bash
bun run build
```
